# Amtrack_performance_vizualization

The project explores Amtrak's system of train's across the continental United States. The dashboard provides visualizations of ridership, arrivals, departures and delays, in order to offer visual insight into performance of the railroad network. In keeping with Amtrak's own vision for projected changes by 2035, the dashboard serves as a tool to make informed decisions on improvements to the system of trains, on the basis of passenger congestion and timely arrivals and departures.
